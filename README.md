# Advanced-IR-Project

### description
This repository contains the code for the Advanced Information Retrieval project. The project is focused on building a search engine that can retrieve relevant documents based on user queries. The search engine uses cluster based retrieval and clustering techniques to improve the relevance of the retrieved documents.


### how to run the code
the main file to run is the *retrieval_pyseriny.py* file, which contains the function *run_final_cluster_based_retreival* that handles the retrieval process with option for hyperparameter tuning. The project also includes the topics and queries files used in our experiments, as well as the results of the experiments in the *saved runs* repository.
